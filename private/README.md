**private folder**

All files inside a top-level directory called `private/` are only accessible from server code and can be loaded via the [`Assets`](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/assets_getText) API. This can be used for private data files and any files that are in your project directory that you don't want to be accessible from the outside.
